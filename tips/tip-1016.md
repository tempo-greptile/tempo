# TIP-1016: Pause Enforcement for Mint and Burn

## Abstract

TIP-1016 requires TIP-20 tokens to enforce the paused state for mint and burn operations. When a token is paused, minting or burning (including memo variants) must revert with `ContractPaused`. This aligns supply-changing operations with existing pause behavior for transfers and rewards.

## Motivation

Pausing a token is intended to freeze balance-affecting activity during incidents or administrative actions. Today, transfers are blocked while paused, but issuers can still change balances by minting or burning. This weakens the pause mechanism and makes incident response less predictable. The change ensures paused tokens cannot change total supply or balances via mint/burn pathways.

# Specification

When `paused == true` for a TIP-20 token:

1. `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` MUST revert with `ContractPaused`.
2. `burn(uint256 amount)` MUST revert with `ContractPaused`.
3. `mintWithMemo(address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 memo)` MUST revert with `ContractPaused`.
4. `burnWithMemo(uint256 amount, bytes32 memo)` MUST revert with `ContractPaused`.

All other TIP-20 behaviors remain unchanged, including:
- `approve()`/`permit()` (no balance movement) remain allowed while paused.
- Existing pause enforcement for transfers and reward functions remains in effect.

# Invariants

1. While paused, calls to mint/burn (including memo variants) never change balances or total supply.
2. When unpaused, mint/burn behavior matches prior semantics.

## Test Cases

1. Paused token rejects `mint` with `ContractPaused`.
2. Paused token rejects `burn` with `ContractPaused`.
3. Paused token rejects `mintWithMemo` and `burnWithMemo` with `ContractPaused`.
4. Unpaused token continues to mint and burn normally.
